# Record-videos-of-animated-ouputs-Matlab-
This repository was created to share my code and technique for recording animated figures from Matlab as video files (i.e - avi).
In particluar, it is an outline of what I used to record videos that are on my youtube channel, an example of random outputs can be found at;

Note that since the creation of the matlab file  (2016), some of the coding techniques I have used may have since be outdated by my coding standards; I will eventually go through the code,update it and then re upload.
